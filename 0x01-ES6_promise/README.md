# Promises in JavaScript

This project is a collection of examples and explanations of how to use Promises in JavaScript. Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, and they can be very useful for managing tasks such as making network requests or reading and writing files.

# What are Promises?

A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value. A Promise can be in one of three states:

Pending: The Promise's outcome has not yet been determined, because the asynchronous operation that will produce its result has not yet completed.
Fulfilled: The asynchronous operation has completed, and the Promise has a resulting value.
Rejected: The asynchronous operation failed, and the Promise will never be fulfilled. In the rejected state, a Promise has a reason that indicates why the operation failed.
Once a Promise is fulfilled or rejected, it stays in that state. It cannot be reset or changed.
